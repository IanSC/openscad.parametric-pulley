# openscad.pulley-generator


This is a generic version of [http://thingiverse.com/thing:16627](http://thingiverse.com/thing:16627)

Changes to this version:

- Fully self contained module, no globals. Several pulleys can be displayed at once.
- Combined all definitions of a pulley model to the same place. Easier to add new models.
- Separated parts of the assembly for easier modifications.
- Auto flip if base is bigger than the teeth.
- Removed base rounded corners if base is smaller.

<b>Original Message from rbuckland:</b>

I had a need to produce a timing pulley for a real car timing belt.
The original author's design was spot on, I just needed to modularise it a bit and do some minor cleanup.

Enjoy!
